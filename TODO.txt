Here are enhancements that typically require additional cost for a site like yours:

1. Form Backend Services (beyond free tier)
Services like Formcarry, Formspree, Getform, etc. have free plans with limits (submissions/month, features).
Paid plans unlock higher limits, file uploads, spam protection, integrations, etc.
2. Newsletter/Email Marketing Platforms
Services like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Brevo, etc. are free up to a certain number of subscribers/emails.
Paid plans needed for automation, advanced analytics, or larger lists.
3. Custom Domain & Professional Email
Buying a custom domain (e.g., squeaky-kleen.ng) and using branded email (e.g., info@squeaky-kleen.ng) costs money.
4. Premium Hosting/Deployment
Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Pages are free for most static sites, but advanced features (team, analytics, bandwidth) may cost extra.
5. Booking/Calendar/Payment Integrations
Embedding a booking system (like Calendly, Acuity, or a custom solution) may have costs for advanced features.
Payment gateways (Paystack, Stripe, PayPal) may have transaction fees or monthly costs for advanced features.
6. Advanced Analytics
Google Analytics is free, but some analytics tools (like Plausible, Fathom) are paid.
7. Stock Images, Icons, or Fonts
Most assets can be free, but premium images, icon sets, or custom fonts may require a license.
8. SEO/Marketing Tools
Tools for keyword research, competitor analysis, or advanced SEO audits (e.g., SEMrush, Ahrefs) are paid.
Summary:
All core features can be free, but scaling, automation, or advanced integrations usually require a paid plan or service.
